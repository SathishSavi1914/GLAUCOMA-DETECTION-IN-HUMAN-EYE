# GLAUCOMA-DETECTION-IN-HUMAN-EYE
In our project, we develop a figuring in which we recognize GLAUCOMA in starting periods by using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in light of visual picture getting ready. This visual picture getting ready in perspective of the Deep Learning. A significant learning structure is proposed remembering the ultimate objective to get a different leveled depiction of FUNDUS pictures to isolate among GLAUCOMA and NON-GLAUCOMA outline. Wide examinations are performed on the FUNDUS and OCT pictures datasets. The condition of the vascular arrangement of human the eye is an imperative characteristic factor in ophthalmology. Its division in fundus imaging is a troublesome endeavor due to distinctive anatomical structures like vein, optic glass, optic plate, macula, and fovea. Vein division can help the distinguishing proof of masochist changes which are possible markers for arteriosclerosis, retinopathy? micro aneurysms and macular degeneration. The division of optic plate and optic holder from retinal pictures are used to figure a basic pointer, glass â€“ to plate extent (CDR) accurately to help the specialists around Glaucoma in fundus pictures. In this proposed work, a robotized division of anatomical structures in fundus pictures, for instance, vein and optic circle is done using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
